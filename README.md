## Github Actions

This repository contains GitHub Actions that you may find useful.

If you clone or create this repository outside the MetaMask GitHub organization,
you probably want to run `./scripts/cleanup.sh` to remove some files that will
not work properly outside the MetaMask GitHub organization.

If you don't wish to use any of the existing GitHub actions in this repository,
simply delete the `.github/workflows` directory.

### Testing and Linting

Run `yarn test` to run the tests once.

Run `yarn lint` to run the linter, or run `yarn lint:fix` to run the linter and
fix any automatically fixable issues.

### Using NPM packages with scripts
Scripts are disabled by default for security reasons. If you need to use NPM
packages with scripts, you can run `yarn allow-scripts auto`, and enable the
script in the `lavamoat.allowScripts` section of `package.json`.
